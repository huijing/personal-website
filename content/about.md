### So who are you?

{{< img2x filename="headshot" filetype="jpg" alt="Profile photo" class="profile-image" >}}

My name is Chen Hui Jing. I first dipped my toe into the waters of web development when I built my first HTML website in 2008 for the Malaysia Basketball Association. 

From there, I discovered the existence of content management systems and migrated the site over to Drupal. I stopped working on the site a year later and put my web development journey on hold (the original site no longer exists either). 

After a 4-year sabbatical (from web development), I decided to restart this journey by diving in head-first this time. In September 2013, I got a job in the web industry and this website chronicles my experiences as I learn new things, fail spectacularly and make cool stuff along the way.

I also founded [Talk.CSS](https://singaporecss.github.io), a meetup around all things CSS, with [Chris Lienert](https://twitter.com/cliener), and ran it with my best mate, [Gao Wei](https://twitter.com/wgao19) after Chris returned to Australia. It is now on indefinite hiatus.

The idea for Talk.CSS was born on the [Kopi.JS](http://kopijs.org/) slack channel on October 26, 2015 and within 2 hours, we had a [logo](https://github.com/Singapore-CSS/logo), a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Singapore-CSS/discussions), a [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-CSS/) account, a venue for the meetup and a couple speakers.

### Anything not related to the web?

Sure. I love playing basketball and did so full-time for 6 years until the end of 2011. I have since retorn my ACL and have officially “hung them up”, or a direct translation of 高挂球鞋。Thankfully, Wei got me into climbing. She's [very good at it](https://instagram.com/_weiclimbs).

I also love to [draw](http://cyern.deviantart.com), though I do less of it now. At one point in time, I customised canvas sneakers for friends and some random clients under the name FUZN designs. The [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/fuzndesigns?fref=ts) still exists, though on an indefinite hiatus.

Wei and I are working on a project called [RedViolaPanda](https://redviolapanda.com/). It's about the adventures of a red panda named Viola (who loves playing her viola) and all her fluffy musician friends. Read the [intro blog post](/blog/what-is-redviolapanda) and please ask me to tell you more.

I play a lot of video games as well, mostly on my PC now since I built my own gaming rig in 2012 (which finally died in 2022, a decade is wonderful). Now I have a new rig, which hopefully will also last a decade. I got myself a PS3, almost 10 years after it was first released to play a bunch of exclusives I always wanted. And now, also a Nintendo Switch.

Oh, and I sometimes cycle around town on my trusty second-hand Muji commuter bicycle, but climate change, the weather is untenable these days.

### Elsewhere on the interwebs

### So how was this site built?

With blood, sweat and tears! Nah, I'm just kidding.

*Update: major migration from Jekyll to Hugo which took 3 days during the COVID-19 pandemic.*

This is a ~~[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)~~ [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site, hosted on ~~[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)~~ [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It was ~~built~~ migrated after months of procrastination and hours upon hours of ~~pressing ⌘-⇧-R, resizing windows~~ ploughing through documentation, googling and of course, actual coding. This site is a constant work-in-progress as I add tweaks, features and content. 

Since ~~Jekyll~~ Hugo is a static site generator, everything here is HTML, CSS and JS. 

No PHP, no Go, no Python, nilch.
