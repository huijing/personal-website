Blogging about blogging seems kinda meta to me. It's definitely fun to see how and why folks started and continue to blog. I got tagged by [Hidde](https://hidde.blog), so why not get this going?

<p class="no-margin"><strong>Why did you start blogging in the first place?</strong></p>

Back in 2013, my first development job was at an agency and after almost coming up to 2 years, I had been thinking of moving onto somewhere else. I did solve a lot of bugs and learn a lot of things during my time there. But I realised I couldn't take the code I wrote with me. So I did the next best thing and wrote my solutions into blog posts with generic examples, so that future me could have something to fall back on.

<p class="no-margin"><strong>What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?</strong></p>

Right now it's a website built with Hugo. I chose it because my original Jekyll site took a really long time to build and someone said that Hugo was fast. I wrote about [the migration](/blog/migrating-from-jekyll-to-hugo). Also, I was running into a bunch of deprecation issues with Ruby and some Github Pages gem and this and that.

<p class="no-margin"><strong>How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that‚Äôs part of your blog?</strong></p>

I just write on a new markdown file generated with the command `hugo new PATH_TO_NEW_BLOG`.

<p class="no-margin"><strong>When do you feel most inspired to write?</strong></p>

At the most random moments. Or when I solve a problem that required a significant investment of my youth, and I therefore feel compelled to write it down so I don't have to think that hard ever again.

<p class="no-margin"><strong>Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?</strong></p>

I usually just hit publish and fix mistakes later. <span class="kaomoji">‰πÅ ‚Å†(‚Å†¬†‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†_‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†¬†‚Å†)‚Å† „Ñè</span>

<p class="no-margin"><strong>What‚Äôs your favourite post on your blog?</strong></p>

Ooooo, I actually have a few that I like, but I'll go with [Where did CSS named colours come from?](/blog/where-did-css-named-colours-come-from), because I just like colours. Apparently my all time best performing blog post is [East Asian character emojis „äóÔ∏è üà∂Ô∏è üàØÔ∏è üà≥Ô∏è](/blog/east-asian-character-emojis), go figure.

<p class="no-margin"><strong>Who are you writing for?</strong></p>

Future me! Because I have no confidence that I'll be smarter than I am now in the future. Not that I'm smart now, just that things only go downhill from here. It's called aging.

<p class="no-margin"><strong>Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?</strong></p>

I know it's super popular, especially around web developers who do frontend to refresh their websites fairly regularly. But when I came up with this design more than a decade ago, I wanted it to feel like me. Every year I look at it, and think, is this still me? And the answer, for better or for worse, is still yes. So I have kept the same design for more than a decade. Sue me.

<p class="no-margin"><strong>Who&#39;s next?</strong></p>

<p class="no-margin">Seems like this has been going around for a while, and I'm not sure if these people have been tagged yet but here goes:</p>

<ul>
  <li class="no-margin"><a href="https://zellwk.com/">Zell Liew</a>, my very first frontend friend and now a more than a decade long buddy</li>
  <li><a href="https://csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts</a>, because he‚Äôs a very cool guy whom I have not seen in ages</li>
</ul>
